## localStorage

All invoice data is persisted in the browser's localStorage under the key `"invoices"`. No backend or database is required. Data survives page refreshes but is scoped to the browser/device.

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The app is fully responsive across three breakpoints:

| Breakpoint         | Target        |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| `max-width: 420px` | Mobile phones |
| `421px – 1024px`   | Tablets       |
| `1025px+`          | Desktop       |

> **Note:** The responsive layout was implemented with the assistance of AI (Claude by Anthropic) due to time constraints during development. The core application logic, component architecture, and feature implementation were built manually.
